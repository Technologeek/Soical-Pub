/**
 * The contract describes the communication between all the module elements.
 * Using a contract class ensures we are following S.O.L.I.D Principle :
 * 1. Single Responsibility Principle : A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
 * 2. Open-closed Principle : Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
 * 3. Interface Segregation Principle : A Client should not be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use.
 * 4. Dependency Inversion Principle : High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
 * Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
